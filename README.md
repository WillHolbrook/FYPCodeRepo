#### Pre-commit Hooks

This project makes use of pre-commit hooks.
To install them first download pre-commit using pip:

```pip install pre-commit```

Then install the hooks specified in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` by running `pre-commit install`

Further details can be found [here](https://pre-commit.com/)

Python pre-commit hooks are set up to only run on the "backend" directory and "JavaScript" are only set up for the frontend directory
