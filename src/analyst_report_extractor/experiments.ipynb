      "3i has announced that it, and its co-investor Cathay Capital, has entered into exclusive negotiations to sell Havea Group to BC Partners, alongside Havea's management team. Closing is expected in Q4 22 and proceeds are expected to be at around a 50% uplift to its 31/3/22 valuation. Havea, a leading European natural healthcare business acquired in 2017, was valued by 3i at Â£304m at 31/3/22 (2.4% of NAV) vs Â£196m cost. A 50% uplift implies gross proceeds of Â£456m and 2.3x money over 5 years. We add this to our model as an unrealised gain in FY H1 and a realised gain in FY H2 and, taking into account carry, we estimate that it increases our live NAVe by 14pps from 1359.4pps to 1373.4pps, or 1%. This has a knock-on effect to our longer term estimates. These are shown in the table below, noting that they also reflect forex movements since we last published on 20/5/22 -these rise by around 2%. The share price at the moment of 1068pps (@9.45) in our view reflects market scepticism about fair values at 31/3/22, since when the MSCI Europe and MSCI World have fallen 10.6% and 7.2% respectively (Â£ TR) vs 3i down 20.5%. Our estimates assume flat earnings multiples on the basis that 3i is likely to reduce the earnings multiple discounts it applies to public comps when it undertakes the next exercise at 30.6.22 (expected to be announced late July). Thus the NAV will become less conservative than before, but we think the market is being overly pessimistic and a sale of a top ten asset at a 50% premium to its 31/3/22 mark supports our view by sending precisely the opposite message. The bigger point is that 3i owns control positions in its companies so while the valuation of private businesses is usually less than public market equivalents due to the 'illiquidity discount' build into the valuation process, it does not include a control premium which is usually captured on exit. We have recently seen a number of listed PE companies sell businesses at 20%+ uplifts to 31/3/22 valuations, so taking a longer term view we believe that wide discounts in listed PE represent excellent value. Based on our live NAVe the discount on 3i is 22.2% vs an average premium 16.3% since 2014, and noting that even during COVID-19 it only hit a 1% discount (see chart below). We remain Overweight with 3i one of our key picks with a relatively defensive portfolio that navigated COVID-19 very successfully, and in our view will be similarly robust in the event of a recession. Most interest rate risk is hedged at the underlying company level, while 3i itself has long term fixed rate financing (Â£375m fixed at 5.75% to 2032 and Â£400m fixed at 3.75% to 2040). The proceeds from this transaction will also likely more than fund the recent new investments, such that we estimate proforma net gearing at the 3i level to be around only 4% of NAV.
