# Feedback From Faye

First of all this is really impressive - a real business tool that can be easily used by anyone.  
My brain is already thinking of the many applications that your summariser tool can be directed / pointed to - well done!  
Not sure where your thinking is at the moment or if you have the opportunity to, but it would be good to see how you 
evolve it further as there is so much potential.  
In terms of areas to improve, I'm being very nitpicky here, 
British vs. American English spelling - I have a preference for Analyser vs Analyzer, similar to Summariser over 
Summarizer - this is of course my personal choice.
